# Aptos — Star Whale Tracker

Monitors Aptos mainnet for single transactions moving **50 million+ APT** (~$300M+ at times).

Aptos is built for speed.  
Most chains choke at 100k TPS.  
Aptos hits 160k+ and doesn’t even blink.

This script watches for the moment  
someone actually **uses** that power.

## Run

```bash
python aptos_star_whale.py
